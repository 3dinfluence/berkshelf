Add source support to Cookbookfile
 - Allow unofficial cookbook repositories to be used via 'source' in Cookbookfile
Add path block support
 - Allow this syntax in Cookbookfile:
    path '/path/to/cookbooks' do
      cookbook 'nginx'
      cookbook 'ntp'
      cookbook 'mysql'
    end
Supress dep_selector stdout
Optimize cookbook retrieval
 - Possible: Pester Opscode till they release an API call to retrieve cookbook dependencies
 - Possible: Keep an index of dependencies so we don't have to download cookbook versions we've seen before
